## Rounded Tildes Styles   
This is a custom Stylus theme I made for tildes.net to give it a more rounded look.  

### Before you install  
 - Install the Stylus browser extension - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) | [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)  
(_Note: This hasn't been tested very well on Chrome as I mainly use Firefox_)  
#### Auto Installation (recommended)  
 - Goto  [Rounded Tildes - Vignesh](https://userstyles.world/style/10370/rounded-tildes-vignesh) styles page  
 - Click on "Install"  
 - It'll open your extension page, then click on the "Install Style" in the top left
 - Done!
#### Manual Installation  
 - Download the styles.json file
 - Open the Stylus extension -> Manage -> Import -> select the styles.json file
 - Done!
