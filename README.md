## Rounded Tildes Styles  
This is a custom Stylus theme I made for tildes.net to give it a more rounded look.

### Installation  
 - Install the Stylus browser extension - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) | [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
  _Note: This hasn't been tested on Chrome_  
 - Goto  [Rounded Tildes - Vignesh](https://userstyles.world/style/10370/rounded-tildes-vignesh)
 - Click on "Install".
 - It'll open your extension page and click on the "Install Style" in the top left.
